# ML-data
Datasets for my Machine Learning project

Data was created using '/data creation.py'

This is a synthetic dataset detailing interactions between algorithms/players in a Game Theory experiment called the "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma" or 'IPD'.
It uses the axelrod python library, which is the main point of interest for research related to the IPD. 
The repo can be found at: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod
