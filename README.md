# ML-data
Datasets for my Machine Learning project

This is a synthetic dataset detailing interactions between algorithms/players in a Game Theory experiment called the "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma" or 'IPD'.
It uses the axelrod python library, which is the main point of interest for research related to the IPD. 
The repo can be found at: https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod

Data was created using '/data creation.py', then '/alpha_to_numeric.py' to convert outputs of C and D to 1 and 0, as required for application to my machine learning models

Data used in my coursework (for access by academic staff):
  training_binary.csv
  test_binary.csv
